Once you have downloaded PerlQt, you should extract it into some
convienient directory where it will be built.

PerlQt uses QTDIR to determine where the Qt includes and stuff are.
This may be set in the environment with something like

export QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt

or specified on the make command-line with

make QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt

Either way is fine with me.

The configuration of PerlQt is, at this stage, manual. There are two
relevant files to edit. For libperlqt, edit libperlqt/Makefile.PL and
change whatever you need to get it to work on your platform. For the rest
of PerlQt, edit Qt.config. The Qt.config file contains a %QtConfig hash
which contains values that will be incorporated into all of the module
Makefile.PL's. The ExtUtils::MakeMaker manpage can help you determine
which configuration settings you can change.

The first step to building PerlQt is to enter the libperlqt directory
within the PerlQt source-tree and run the commands:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

Following that, go into the main PerlQt source dir and type:

perl Makefile.PL

This will announce that makefiles have been created for more than 50
modules. Next, run

make

And optionally,

make install

Then, you run the tutorials by going into the tutorial's directory
(t1, for example) and running:

./t1

or, if you didn't install PerlQt:

perl -I../../blib/lib -I../../blib/arch t1

And that's it.

Bug-reports are welcome. Send a report, including the error, to
jql@accessone.com, and include the output from Perl -V and uname -a so I
can understand your error better.
