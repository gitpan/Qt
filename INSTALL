Once you have downloaded PerlQt, you should extract it into some
convienient directory where it will be built.

Make sure you have your QTDIR environment-variable set to the main Qt
directory before attempting to compile PerlQt. The QTDIR environment
variable is used to find the Qt include files.

The first step to building PerlQt is to enter the libperlqt directory
within the PerlQt source-tree and run the commands:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

Following that, go into the main PerlQt source dir and type:

perl Makefile.PL

This will announce that makefiles have been created for a couple-dozen
modules. Next, run

make

And optionally,

make install

Then, you run the tutorials by going into the tutorial's directory
(t1, for example) and running:

./t1

or, if you didn't install PerlQt:

perl -I../../blib/lib -I../../blib/arch t1

And that's it.

Bug-reports are welcome. Send a report, including the error, to
jql@accessone.com, and include the output from Perl -V and uname -a so I
can understand your error better.
