This file contains the installation instructrions for libperlqt.

libperlqt need to know your QTDIR with either

export QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt

before compiliation, or with a

make QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt

instead of a plain 'make'


First, you need to create a Makefile using the command

perl Makefile.PL

Then you need to compile the library using

make

This builds a shared library named libperlqt.so somewhere in blib/ that is
linked with all of the PerlQt modules.

By default, libperlqt installs into /usr/local/lib and the only way to
change that is to edit the Makefile.PL at the point where it says

	cp $(INST_DYNAMIC) /usr/local/lib

and change the location from /usr/local/lib to wherever you'd prefer it be
installed. I'll try to fix this later. Oh, and you have to run
perl Makefile.PL after you edit Makefile.PL, or the change will not be
honored.

Finally, install it with:

make install

Once you have installed libperlqt, you may continue with the main PerlQt
compiliation.
