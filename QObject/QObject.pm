timerEvent

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Except for children() and queryList(), every public QObject member-function
is fully-implemented. Unless noted below, all of those functions are
completely direct interfaces.

=over 4

=item $connected = $reciever->connect(sender, signal, member)

Do I<NOT> attempt to use SIGNAL() or SLOT() on the signal and member
arguments. They are not needed by PerlQt, because the connect() function
can automatically determine whether the member argument is a signal or a
slot, and the signal will always be a signal. The signal and member
arguments must be strings. And at the moment, there isn't much room for
error.

=item $connected = QObject::connect(sender, signal, reciever, member)

Same as above listing, just as a normal function with a different
argument-list.

=item $disconnected = $sender->disconnect(signal = undef, reciever = undef, member = undef)

Remember I<NOT> to use SIGNAL() and SLOT() with disconnect(). This function
takes over for both the static disconnect() and the 3-arg member disconnect()
in Qt.

=item $disconnected = $sender->disconnect(reciever, member = undef)

Same warning about SIGNAL() and SLOT() as above.

=item timerEvent(event)

This is a virtual function, meant to be reimplemented in your own
classes. It is currently available through QObject and QWidget.

=back

=head2 Signals and slots

Signals and slots are implemented in a limited way at the moment. You may
use no-arg signals and slots freely, as well as 1 and 2 integer argument
signals and slots.

The declaration of signals and slots is done through the usage
of 'use signals' and 'use slots'. Any classes which have QObject
in their inheritance tree are free to use signals/slots after their
superclass has been included via require/use.

=over 4

=item use signals 'sig1()', ..., 'sigx(int,int)'

The arguments to C<use signals> must be strings representing the signal
prototypes I<excluding> the object parameter. You may use C<qw()> to quote
the function prototypes, but it warns about commas when B<-w> is in use.

Add spaces at your own risk. Misspell at your own risk. PerlQt doesn't
do any error-checking yet. All error-checking that is done is done by
Qt. You may run C<use signals> as many times as you want. I'm pretty
sure that if you define the same signal-name twice, the latter prototype
is used. But you should get a redefined function warning. Also, the
argument-types are not checked yet.

Running C<use signals> exports a function named C<emit> into your namespace.
It does nothing, and is just there for clarity and consistency with Qt
where the emit keyword is just as void. When you emit a signal, you I<must>
call it as a method-call C<$self-E<gt>signal()>, and not as C<'signal()'>
or C<signal()> because it is not a string and it is not a normal function.

=item use slots 'slot1()', ..., 'slotx(int)'

The arguments to C<use slots> must be strings representing the prototypes
of the slots you want to declare I<excluding> the object parameter. The slot
functions aren't cached by PerlQt, and are always called as full method-calls.

Once you declare a function as being a slot, you may use connect() to
connect any signal, Perl or C++, to it.

=back

=head1 BUGS

Signals and slots are seriously crippled. They do not check their arguments,
they only allow a couple of I<integer only> arguments, and there's a
serious memory-leak which I can only attribute to signals and slots
or to virtual member-function overrides. At the moment, PerlQt signals
and slots are little more than proof-of-concept and it will take
significant effort to get it working right. Any suggestions are welcome.
