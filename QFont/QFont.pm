=head1 DESCRIPTION

What you see is what you get.

=head1 EXPORTED

Three hashes, C<%StyleHint>, C<%Weight>, and C<%CharSet>, are exported into
the user's namespace. They correspond to the three enums in the QFont
class, and, if combined, contain all the constant values that were
accessed through QFont:: in C++.

To refresh your memory without requiring you to read F<qfont.h>, 
C<%StyleHint> elements are font-names S<(Helvetica, Times, etc)>,
C<%Weight> elements are the character's darkness S<(Light, Bold, etc)>,
C<%CharSet> should be obvious enough to anyone who needs it.
